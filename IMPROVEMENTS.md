# Application Improvements - Prioritized

This document outlines potential improvements for the Alerion application, categorized by area and prioritized based on impact and effort.

## 1. Performance & Optimization (High Priority)

### Frontend:

- **Lazy Loading Components/Routes:** Implement React's `lazy` and `Suspense` for routes and components that are not immediately needed on page load. This will reduce initial bundle size and improve Time To Interactive (TTI).
- **Image Optimization:** Ensure all images are properly sized, compressed, and served in modern formats (e.g., WebP). Consider using a CDN for image delivery.
- **Virtualization for Large Lists:** For components displaying large datasets (e.g., tables in Seller Tools), implement virtualization (e.g., `react-window` or `react-virtualized`) to render only visible rows, significantly improving performance.
- **Memoization:** Utilize `React.memo`, `useMemo`, and `useCallback` to prevent unnecessary re-renders of components and expensive computations.

### Backend:

- **Database Query Optimization:** Review and optimize MongoDB and PostgreSQL queries. Ensure proper indexing is in place for frequently queried fields.
- **API Response Caching:** Implement caching mechanisms (e.g., Redis) for frequently accessed API endpoints to reduce database load and improve response times.
- **Lambda Cold Starts:** Investigate and mitigate AWS Lambda cold start issues for critical API Gateway endpoints, potentially by using Provisioned Concurrency or optimizing bundle size.

## 2. Code Quality & Maintainability (High Priority)

- **Comprehensive Unit and Integration Tests:** Expand test coverage using Jest and `@testing-library/react` for all critical components, utilities, and API endpoints. This ensures reliability and facilitates future refactoring.
- **Consistent Error Handling:** Standardize error handling across both frontend and backend. Provide meaningful error messages to users and robust logging for developers.
- **Code Documentation:** Enhance JSDoc/TSDoc comments for functions, components, and interfaces, especially for complex logic or public APIs. Maintain up-to-date READMEs for each module.
- **Refactor Large Components/Files:** Break down overly large components or utility files into smaller, more focused modules to improve readability and reusability.

## 3. Security (Medium Priority)

- **Input Validation:** Implement strict input validation on both frontend and backend to prevent common vulnerabilities like XSS and SQL injection.
- **Dependency Auditing:** Regularly audit and update project dependencies to patch known security vulnerabilities. Integrate tools like `npm audit` into the CI/CD pipeline.
- **Environment Variable Management:** Ensure all sensitive information (API keys, database credentials) is securely managed using environment variables and not hardcoded.
- **CORS Configuration:** Review and tighten CORS policies on the Express backend to only allow requests from trusted origins.

## 4. User Experience & Features (Medium Priority)

- **Loading States and Skeletons:** Implement more granular loading indicators and skeleton screens for data-intensive sections to improve perceived performance and user feedback.
- **Form Validation Feedback:** Provide clear, real-time validation feedback for all user input forms.
- **Accessibility (A11y) Improvements:** Conduct an accessibility audit and implement ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation, and proper focus management to make the application usable for all.
- **Offline Support/PWA Features:** Explore adding basic offline capabilities or converting parts of the application into a Progressive Web App (PWA) for enhanced reliability and engagement.

## 5. Infrastructure & Deployment (Low Priority)

- **CI/CD Pipeline Enhancement:** Automate more stages of the CI/CD pipeline, including linting, testing, and deployment to different environments.
- **Containerization (Docker):** Further leverage Docker for consistent development, testing, and production environments, especially for the Node.js backend and PostgreSQL/MongoDB instances.
- **Monitoring & Logging:** Implement comprehensive application monitoring and centralized logging solutions (e.g., AWS CloudWatch, ELK stack) to quickly identify and diagnose issues in production.
